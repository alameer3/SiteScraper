# Website Analyzer

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that provides comprehensive website analysis capabilities. The application allows users to input a URL and receive detailed insights about the website's structure, technology stack, SEO optimization, and navigation patterns. It combines web scraping, content analysis, and technology detection to provide actionable intelligence for understanding and potentially replicating website architectures.

## User Preferences

- **Communication style**: Arabic language, simple and clear explanations  
- **Technical approach**: Thorough debugging and complete solutions
- **Code quality**: Fix all errors completely, no incomplete implementations

## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional Flask MVC architecture with the following key characteristics:

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web framework with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite for development (configurable to other databases via DATABASE_URL environment variable)
- **Threading**: Background processing for website analysis to prevent UI blocking
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with configurable secret keys

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 dark theme
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Bootstrap integration
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for form validation and progress tracking
- **Icons**: Feather Icons for consistent UI elements
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for analytics display

## Key Components

### Core Analysis Engine
1. **WebScraper Class** (`scraper.py`):
   - Implements respectful crawling with robots.txt compliance
   - Configurable crawl depth and delay settings
   - Session-based HTTP requests with proper user agent headers
   - URL validation and domain boundary enforcement

2. **WebsiteAnalyzer Class** (`analyzer.py`):
   - Technology stack detection using pattern matching
   - CMS identification (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc.)
   - Framework detection (React, Vue, Angular, jQuery, etc.)

3. **Database Models** (`models.py`):
   - ScrapeResult model with JSON storage for analysis data
   - Structured data storage for different analysis categories
   - Status tracking for async operations

### Data Categories
The system analyzes and stores five main categories of website data:
- **Structure Data**: HTML structure and semantic analysis
- **Assets Data**: Images, CSS, JavaScript files inventory
- **Technology Data**: Framework, library, and CMS detection
- **SEO Data**: Meta tags, titles, optimization metrics
- **Navigation Data**: Site structure and link analysis

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: URL submission through web interface with validation
2. **Background Processing**: Threaded analysis to maintain UI responsiveness
3. **Web Scraping**: Respectful crawling with configurable depth limits
4. **Content Analysis**: Multi-faceted analysis of scraped content
5. **Data Storage**: JSON serialization of analysis results in SQLite
